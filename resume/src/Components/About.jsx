      <p>
        Hi, I'm Rishitha Nallapureddy from Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at KL University. I have a strong passion for web development and I'm learning the MERN stack. I also participated in the Smart India Hackathon with my team ‘TechBoo’, where we reached Level 4 and won 1st place at Level 2!
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from coding, I enjoy indoor activities and creative projects. I'm adaptable, flexible, and love working on interesting ideas. I’ve also built projects like an e-commerce website for spices and a game called “Dora Bujji”. I also have experience with software testing.
